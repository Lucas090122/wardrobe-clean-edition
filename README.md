#  Wardrobe – Smart Family Clothing Organizer

##  Overview
**Wardrobe** is a mobile application designed to help families manage and organize their clothes efficiently.  
Users can create multiple members, upload or photograph clothing items, categorize them with tags, and track seasonal storage.  
The app also supports localization for different languages.

---

##  Key Features

-  **Multi-member support** – each family member has their own wardrobe.  
-  **Add & edit clothes** – upload or take photos of clothing items.  
-  **Global tag system** – reusable tags for quick filtering and organization.  
-  **Seasonal organization** – mark and store clothes by season.  
-  **Localization support** – automatic language selection based on system language.  
-  **Drawer menu** – access app settings, dark mode, and member management.

#### **Entity Overview**
- **Member** – stores user info such as name, gender, age, and optional birth date.  
- **ClothingItem** – represents a clothing record (description, image URI, created time), including extended attributes such as category, warmth level, occasions, waterproof flag, color, season, last worn time, favorite status, and optional size label.  
- **Tag** – global shared tags (e.g., “Winter”, “Formal”, “Sports”).  
- **Location** – stores physical storage information, such as `locationId` and `name` (e.g., “Main Wardrobe”, “Storage Box A”).  
- **TransferHistory** – records the transfer of a clothing item between members, including source member, target member, and transfer time.  
- **NfcTag** – represents a physical NFC tag bound to a specific storage location, using a unique hardware ID.

**Relationships:**  
  - Each **Member** can own multiple **ClothingItem** records.  
  - Each **ClothingItem** belongs to exactly one **Member**.  
  - Each **ClothingItem** can have multiple **Tag**s (many-to-many relationship via `ClothingTagCrossRef`).  
  - Each **Tag** can be linked to multiple **ClothingItem**s.  
  - Each **ClothingItem** can optionally belong to one **Location** (one-to-many relationship from `Location` to `ClothingItem`).  
  - Each **Location** can store multiple **ClothingItem**s.  
  - **TransferHistory** links clothing items with both source and target members to record ownership transfers.  
  - **NfcTag** references a `Location`, allowing users to bind NFC stickers to physical storage spaces for quick lookup.  
  - **Tag**s are globally shared across all members.  
  - When a **Member** is deleted, all related **ClothingItem** and **TransferHistory** entries are also removed.  
  - When a **Location** is deleted, related clothing items’ `locationId` is set to `null`, and related NFC tags are removed.  
  - When a **Tag** or **ClothingItem** is deleted, the corresponding records in `ClothingTagCrossRef` are removed automatically.

##  Project Management

### **Trello Board**
[Trello Backlog & Sprint Plan](https://trello.com/b/ymbal9w5/backlog))

Each sprint includes clear tasks and acceptance criteria following the Agile Scrum methodology.

#### **Sprint 1**
- Establish basic family member system (weak login)
- Improve search & filter logic
- Implement tag statistics
- Add in-use vs stored item categorization
- Create initial Figma design prototype

#### **Sprint 2**
- Responsive UI layout & light/dark theme
- Transfer items between members with history
- Bluetooth sharing as a generated image
- Storage location tracking
- Implement navigation drawer (MD3)

#### **Sprint 3**
- Research image recognition for auto-tagging
- Smart growth notifications for children
- Statistics and charts
- Photo AI prototype for auto-tag & category suggestions

#### **Sprint 4**
- Research Android NFC integration methods
- Research Material Design 3 UI patterns
- NFC-based smart storage prototype
- Localization & multilingual support
- Overall app optimization (UI, recommendation accuracy, user flow)

#### **Sprint 5**
- Write unit tests for core modules  
- Conduct user testing and collect feedback  
- Create onboarding tutorial

##  UI / UX Design

### **Figma Prototype**
[Figma Design Board](https://www.figma.com/design/PwMYy5MikBidqkola0tFQ3/Wardrobe?node-id=0-1&t=gcwxdkpzBlOvIgVo-1)

- Based on **Material 3 Guidelines**  
- Includes light/dark mode  
- Responsive layouts tested on multiple screen sizes  

---

## Unit Testing Summary

We implemented unit tests for all core business logic components (ViewModels and utilities).  
Android framework code, UI Composables, Room DAO, and remote API components were intentionally excluded because they belong to instrumented tests.

**Full testing documentation is available [HERE](./TESTING.md)**

## How to Run

### 1. Clone the repository
```bash
git clone https://github.com/Lucas090122/wardrobe.git
cd wardrobe
```

### 2. Open the project in Android Studio
Open the folder in Android Studio (Hedgehog or newer).

### 3. Sync Gradle & Run
Gradle will sync automatically.  
Run the app on an emulator or a physical Android device.

---

## 4. (Optional) Enable AI auto-tagging using Google Gemini

The app supports automatic clothing analysis (category, color, warmth, tags, and localized description) powered by Google Gemini Flash.

Follow these steps to enable the AI features:

---

### Step 1 — Create a Gemini API key

1. Visit Google AI Studio:  
   https://aistudio.google.com/
2. Sign in with your Google account  
3. Open 'API Keys' from the left sidebar  
4. Click 'Create API key'  
5. Copy the generated key

---

### Step 2 — Add your API key to the project

Inside the project root, create or edit a file named:
```bash
local.properties
```
Add this line:
```bash
GEMINI_API_KEY=your_api_key_here
```
Note: Do NOT commit this file. 'local.properties' is already in '.gitignore'.

---

### Step 3 — Rebuild the project

Android Studio will automatically inject your API key into:
```bash
BuildConfig.GEMINI_API_KEY
```
---

### Step 4 — Enable AI inside the app

1. Open the Wardrobe app  
2. Open the **Drawer**
3. Turn on the AI-mode toggle  

When enabled, the app will automatically analyze photos and fill:

- description (in your system language)  
- category  
- tags  
- warmth level  
- dominant color
