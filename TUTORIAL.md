### 3.1 Drawer Sections Explained

#### Member
Opens the **member selection** screen.  
This is useful if you want to quickly switch between children or family members.

#### Statistics
Opens the analytics page where you can see distributions of:

- transfer history

---

### 3.2 Drawer Toggles

These global toggles live **inside the drawer**, not inside Settings:

#### Admin Mode
Allows privileged operations such as deleting locations that still contain items.  
Normal users cannot do these operations.

#### AI Mode
Enables or disables AI-powered auto-fill when adding clothing items.  
If turned off, AI requests will not be made.

#### Dark Mode
Switches the entire UI theme between light and dark.

---

After choosing a member and exploring sections via the drawer, the Home Screen becomes the main working area of the app.

Here you can:

- View all clothing items for the current member  
- Filter or scroll through the list  
- Open the side drawer for navigation  
- Add new clothing items

</p>

## 4.2 AI Auto-Fill (Optional)

If AI is enabled in Settings:

1. Add or take a photo of the clothing item  
2. The app sends the image to Gemini  
3. Detected attributes such as **category**, **warmth level**, **color**, or **season** are automatically suggested

The user can still edit all fields before saving.

# 5. NFC Smart Storage

Wardrobe allows you to associate **physical storage locations** (e.g. boxes, shelves) with **NFC stickers**.

## 5.1 Binding an NFC Sticker to a Location

1. Open the **Settings** screen from the drawer  
2. Enter **“Bind Location”** mode (e.g. “Add new NFC sticker”)  
3. Scan an NFC tag with your phone  
4. A dialog appears asking you to choose which Location this tag should represent  
5. Confirm to bind the tag to that Location

<p align="center">
  <img src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/fd08227b-388a-42d8-9f77-405fec629e79" width="240">
</p>

After binding, the tag is stored in the database and linked to that Location.

---

## 5.2 Using NFC to Navigate to a Location

When the app is running (or in foreground) and **NFC mode is Idle**:

1. Scan a known NFC tag  
2. The app resolves the location ID associated with the tag  
3. The `MainViewModel` sets a navigation request  
4. The UI navigates directly to that Location’s screen, showing all stored items there

---

# 6. Location Screen

A Location screen shows:

- Location name / description  
- Thumbnails of clothing stored there  

You can:

- See where each piece of clothing is physically stored

# 7. Item Details & Transfer Between Members

From the clothing list or location view:

1. Tap an item → opens the **Item Detail** screen  
2. You can edit the item information, change favorite status, or move it

To **transfer an item to another member**:

1. Open the Item Detail  
2. Tap the **Transfer** button  
3. Select the target member  
4. Confirm

The app:

- Updates the item owner  
- Records the transfer in **TransferHistory**  
- Shows it later in the transfer history screen

# 8. Statistics Screen

The **Statistics** screen provides an overview of the current member’s wardrobe:

- Distribution by category (tops, bottoms, outerwear, etc.)  
- Seasonal distribution (summer, winter, etc.)  
- Member distribution

Charts are generated using chart libraries and updated automatically from the database.

<p align="center">

  <img src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/9597b302-b843-464a-ba65-0b1d5d4b5db9" width="240">
</p>

This helps users see imbalances (e.g. too many coats, not enough summer clothes).

# 9. Settings Screen

The **Settings** screen contains configuration options such as:

- Change admin mode PIN (If exists)
- Toggle **NFC bind mode**

# 10. Tips & Best Practices

- When starting the app, always choose the correct **active member** on the Member Selection screen.  
- Use NFC stickers on boxes, drawers, or bags to quickly jump to a location in the app.  
- Use AI auto-fill to speed up adding large numbers of items.  
- Transfer items instead of deleting/recreating them when they are passed from one child to another.  
- Use statistics to decide what clothing is missing before going shopping.
